Documentation:
We decided to use pygame as it is a bit simpler to comprehend and implement in a short amount of time compared to other game building tools.

First we built various "scenes" or backgrounds for different events. 
We have a launch screen for beginning the game and selecting which player will play each character. There were a few hiccups with this stage that we would resovle given more time. First we haven't regulated what happens if one player selects a character. We also wanted a "start" to play button that we ran into some issues with.

Then we made a maze scene where the characters spawn in and a maze is available.

We created two characters, Thunder and George the peacock.
